# TCS-HumAIn---Taxonomy-Classification

The aim of the project is to predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries) of a question, given only the question text and its title. The dataset consists of 6M+ of ‘Title’, ‘Body’ and ‘Tags’ of the questions posted on StackOverflow. From disparate stack exchange sites, containing a mix of both technical and non-technical questions. Using Binary Relevance Method with One vs Rest Classifier to achieve more than 94 % accuracy
This repo contains my implementation of the Taxonomy Classification problem for TCS HumAIn Idea submission round
